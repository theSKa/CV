# CV

I used to work as a freelance web designer but became slightly tired of not being able to control how anything I worked on, well, worked. So at the start of 2014, I joined Makers Academy to learn how to develop and it seems to have turned out OK. Since then I’ve mostly worked for Megaphone, working with Rails and Cordova, and all kinds of other interesting stuff.

## Recent Work

For Megaphone, I was the sole developer on MonthlyCollage and one of two on RoundUp (mostly focussed on the app, not the server).

| MonthlyCollage | RoundUp |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Rails app that checks your Instagram photos every month, and makes a collage of all the photos it finds. Sends you an email and everything. Sign up at MonthlyCollage.com, if you fancy. | Events with friends made easy (says the tagline)! Made with Cordova/Ionic (/Angular). Little bits of Swift round the edges for extra touches of functionality. Available on your friendly neighbourhood App Store (so long as your app store is Apple’s, Google’s or Microsoft’s…) |

1. *Cambridge doesn't really count Photography AS-level as a real subject but I almost feel as though of all the subjects I took that year, it probably best prepared me for university and the work I do now. The course was oriented around a series of large projects with all the work we did over the course of the year added to a sketchbook for each project. Each week you pick a new area that interests you, or a new subject to learn about, and just play around in that area of art until you've learned what you need to. You're constantly trying to work out what small things you need to teach yourself in the service of some larger goal. Those kinds of techniques, making sure you're happy with constantly having to (and wanting to) search for new sources of information, are unbelievably valuable.*
